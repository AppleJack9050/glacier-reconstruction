> Abstract: Accurate three-dimensional (3D) modelling of glacier surfaces is technically challenging due to specular reflections and weak texture. This paper presents a rigorous empirical comparison of two different Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines‚ÄîCOLMAP and OpenMVG‚Äîand a recent deep learning based method ACEZero (ACE0), when confronted with such adverse imaging conditions. Using a high-resolution RGB images dataset representative of typical glacier scenes, we quantify reconstruction quality through point-cloud density, root-mean-square reprojection error (RMSE), and Chamfer distance to ground-truth geometry, while profiling computational efficiency in terms of run-time and hardware utilisation (CPU, GPU, RAM, VRAM). OpenMVG achieves the densest point cloud (1.48 M points) and the lowest RMSE (0.68 px), but suffers from substantial global shape deviation (Chamfer distance 429 px) and the longest execution time (7.2 h). ACEZero delivers an order-of-magnitude speed-up (0.8 h) with moderate GPU usage, yet reconstructs the fewest points (0.10 M) and exhibits the highest RMSE (3.58 px). COLMAP offers the most balanced performance, combining competitive density (0.52 M points), low Chamfer distance (28 px) and moderate resource demand (3.2 h). The results delineate clear trade-offs among accuracy, completeness and computational cost, furnishing practical guidance for selecting an appropriate pipeline under varying operational and hardware constraints.
